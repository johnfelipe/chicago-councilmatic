    <h1 class="title">Motivation and Overview</h1>

    <p>I want to be able to follow primary source material on legislation as it
       develops in my city. I also want to have appropraite context around this
       legislation so that I can develop my own better informed opinions. Having
       this ability makes me feel as though I can actually be involved in the
       process of guiding the city &mdash; it opens the black box of how things are
       done, and makes legislation accessible outside of its consequences.</p>
    <p>There are three aspects here:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
        <li>subscription,</li>
        <li>contextualization, and</li>
        <li>evaluation (pros and cons)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Subscription</em>: I want to be able to subscribe to legislation as
       its made available, and to agendas of what's going to be discussed in the
       future. Councilmatic will provide email, RSS, or SMS subscriptions to
       headlines that you desire. It will also present updates to your
       subscribed information in a way that is optimized for your viewing mode,
       be it web or mobile.</p>
    <p><em>Contextualization</em>: I want to see relevant information around
       legislation, like the geographical areas mentioned, supporting areas (with councilember as
       proxy), related legislation, and related information from around the
       internet. Councilmatic will collect meta-information on legislation such
       as the words in a bill, and the other bills that it refers to (determined
       through regular expression analysis). It will also allow users to note
       areas of the city mentioned in legislation.</p>
    <p><em>Evaluation</em>: I want to see the pros and cons of an issue as
       discussed by the wider community. Councilmatic will allow users to not
       only comment on a bill, but also specify whether their comment is is
       support of or opposition to the bill. Other users will be able to
       comments according to their helpfulness. Through this system will emerge
       a set of most helpful supportive and opposing viewpoints on the issues in
       a bill.</p>

    <h1>About the Data</h1>

    <p>The data on Philly.Councilmatic is scraped once a day (early in the
       morning) from the Philadelphia City Council's legislation site. On that
       site, the data is served through an application called InSite. Many
       municipal legislative bodies use some version of this software. It is
       possible that the scraper is able to be used for other cities' InSite
       instances as well.</p>
    <p>Since the data comes from another site, the data quality is only as good
       as its source. If there are empty communications, that is an issue with
       the source. Also, Councilmatic may not have up-to-the-minute information
       about the legislation you are viewing, since it scrapes once per day.
       Each piece of legislation provides a link to its source for reference.<p>
    <p>Councilmatic does add some metadata to the source data: The complete list
       of words that occur in the source title and attachents, as well as which
       other legislation mentions or is mentioned by a particular piece of
       legislation.</p>
